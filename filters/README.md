This will provide details and sources of the filters:

u,g,r,i2,i,z from http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/megapipe/docs/filt.html

y, FUV, NUV, B, V, g+, r+, i+, z+ from http://cosmos.astro.caltech.edu/page/filterset

Good table for this stuff in https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/690/2/1236/pdf

NOTE: I took the HSC y, but probably just need suprime cam y. Might need to fix this in the future!
