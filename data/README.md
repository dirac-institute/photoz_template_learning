COSMOS filters:

obtaining data from SQL module at http://cesam.lam.fr/hstcosmos/search/sql-module


Kept all redshift flags from the recommended sample in the ESO release.

Only keeping galaxies with flag_maskB, flag_maskV, flag_maski, flag_maskz, flag_maskD all equal 0 (per the photometry README).

Type = 0 (galaxy)

NOTE I NEED TO INCLUDE LINKS TO THE READMEs.



VVDS DATA:
described here https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0545
downloaded via interface here: https://cesam.lam.fr/vvds/vvds_criteria.php

downloaded all deep and all wide, keeping very secure redshifts for primaries and secondaries.

Will need to download the appropriate filters.
